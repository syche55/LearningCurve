You can use dictionary to count frequency

If a key is not in the dict, there will be an error, so we use 'in' to check first
>>> 'csev' in ccc
False

counts = dict()
names = ['csev', 'cwen', 'csev', 'zqian', 'cwen']
for name in names:
    if name not in counts:
        counts[name] = 1  <-- this adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary
    else:
        counts[name] = counts[name] + 1
print(counts)
Output:
{'csev':2, 'zqian':1, 'cwen':2}

The get method for dictionaries:
The pattern of checking to see if a key is already in a dictionary 
and assuming a default value if the key is not there is so common 
that there is a method called get() that does this for us

if name in counts:
    x = counts[name]
else:
    x = 0   <--- default, meaning what is not there
FOUR LINES ABOVE CAN BE ONE LINE BELOW:
x = counts.get(name, 0)  <-- name is the key, 0 is the default, 
if key exits, you get value, if key doest exist, you get default

counts = dict()
names = ['csev', 'cwen', 'csev', 'zqian', 'cwen']
for name in names:
    counts[name] = counts.get(name, 0) + 1
print(counts)
