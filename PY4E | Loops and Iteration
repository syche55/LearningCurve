a break makes the program skip any other lines left in the loop
a continue means goes back to the loop and start again

while True:
    line = input('> ')
    if line[0] == '#':
        continue
    if line == 'done':
        break
    print(line)
print('Done')

>hello    
hello    <--print(line) the loop has not finished yet
>#dont print this    <--if line[0] == '#', continue, so the loop starts over again
>print this
print this    <--print(line)
>done    <--break, and skip print(line), exit the loop and goes to the final clause
Done



>>>for i in [5, 4, 3]
>>>    print(i)

>>>friends = ['AA', 'BB', 'CC']
>>>for friend in friends:
>>>    print('Happy', friend)
output:
Happy AA
Happy BB

iterate friend in friends
