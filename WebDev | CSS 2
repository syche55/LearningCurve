- Div
  <div class=""></div>
  you can specify the height, or have content in it.
  
- User Agent Stylesheet

- The box model of website styling
  margin - border - padding - content
  
  width: 100%;  100% of the screen
  border: solid;
  border-width: 0, 20px, 30px, 0; (clock wise)
  padding goes within border and content
  margin is outside border
  margin, border, padding all impact the total size of the box
  
- Display
  Block / Inline / Inline-block / None
  
  Common block elements:
  <p>
  headers
  <div>
  lists and list elements
  <form>
  
  block will have extra space, and will take up the entire screen.
  you have two blocks, and they cannot sit on the same line.
  instead, we can use <span class=""></span>
  <p><span>xxx</span>xxxxx</p>
  span only has a small space between each other
  however, it cannot change width
  
  Common inline elements:
  <span>
  <img>
  <a>
  
  in order to have two blocks in the same line and be able to change the width, use inline-block
  
  display:none;   this makes the item disappear, position no longer there
  visibility: hidden; position still there, item disappear
  
  
- Static and Relative Positioning
  1. content is everything
  2. order comes from code
  3. children sit on parents
  <div><h1><span></span></h1></div>  the span result is the final result
  
  Position:
  Static / Relative / Absolute / Fixed
  
  Static: default
  
  Relative: relative to static
  img{
    position: relative;
    left: 30px;
  }
  left means push from left
  relative position doesnt affect the position of other things on the screen
  
  Absolute: relative to its parent
  say if there is a div outside the img, 
  div{
    position: relative;
  }
  img{
    absolute
    right: 30px;
  }
  this would move the img to the right, with 30px relative to the edge of the div
  when using absolute position, the item would go out of the flow, other items shift (if it was in their way)
  
  Fixed: if you scroll the screen, the item would stick to its position
  often used in navigation bar
  
  
  - Center
  body{
    text-align: centerl;
  }
