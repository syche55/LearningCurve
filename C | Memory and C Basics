Processor registers
Small number (~16 words) of very fast memory locations located in CPU.

Main memory
Hardware is usually dynamic RAM (data goes away if power is turned off)

Cache memory
Faster than main memory
Might have different levels
Hashtable

Virtual memory
The operating system can pretend it has more memory by swapping out infrequently used blocks of memory to disk, 
and swapping back in needed blocks of memory from disk

Hard disk
persistent memory
In short: program is initially on disks, main memory reads from disks. When CPU tries to run it, it checks if cache already has it.
If no, saves it in cache
