Port is like an extension number
Common TCP Ports:
Telnet(23) - Login
SSH(22) - Secure Login
HTTP(80)
HTTPS(443) - Secure
SMTP(25) - Mail
IMAP(143/220/993) - Mail Retrieval
POP(109/110) - Mail Retrieval
DNS(53) - Domain Name
FTP(21) - File Transfer

Sockets in Python
Python has built-in support for TCP Sockets
import socket
mysock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
mysock.connect( ('data.pr4e.org', 80) )  <--'data.pre4.org' is Host, 80 is Port


HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol
The dominant Application Layer Protocol on the Internet
Invented for the Web - to Retrieve HTML, Images, Documents, etc
Extended to be data in addition to documents - RSS, Web Services, etc.. 
Basic Concept - Make a Connection - Request a document - Retrieve the Document - Close the Connection
