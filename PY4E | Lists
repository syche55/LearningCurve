a list element can be any python object, even another list, like a mixing list of str, int, float, list etc

strings are immutable: we cannot change the contents of a string, we must make a new string to make any change
lists are mutable: we can change an element of a list using the index operator
lotto = [2, 14, 26, 41, 63]
lotto[2] = 28

Range function:
>>> print(range(4))
[0, 1, 2, 3]
we can use the len() to help construct a loop:
for i in range(len(friends)):
    friend = friend[i]
    print(Happy New Year:', friend)
Instead of looping through that list itself, we do range len friends, then we can know the position of each element

Concatenating lists using '+'
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b = [4, 5, 6]
>>> print (a + b)
1 2 3 4 5 6

Lists can be sliced using [:] [3:] [:2]

List methods
append, count, extend, index, insert, pop, remove, reverse, sort

stuff = list()
stuff.append(99)

using 'in' 'not in', we can check if an item is in a list, return True or False

.sort() can change the list's order

functions that take lists as their arguement:
len(list), max(list), min(list), sum(list)
