"+" concatenate strings

we prefer to read data in using strings and then parse and convert the data as we need
raw input numbers must be converted from strings

b a n a n a
0 1 2 3 4 5
fruit = 'banana'
len(fruit) 

print(index, letter)

fruit = 'banana'
for letter in fruit
    print(letter)
    

slicing:
>>> s = 'Monty Python'
>>> print (s[6:7])
p

[start, end)
if end goes beyond the str, it stops at the end of the str
if we leave off the first number or the last number of the slice, 
it is assumed to be the beginning or end of the string respectively
>>> print(s[8:])
thon
>>> print(s[:2])
Mo
>>> print(s[:]
Monty Python

The in keyword can also be used to check to see if one string is 'in' another string
the in expression is a logical expression that returns True or False and can be used in an if statement
>>> fruit = 'banana'
>>> 'n' in fruit
True
>>> 'm' in fruit
False
>>> if 'a' in fruit:
        print('Found it!')
Found it!
