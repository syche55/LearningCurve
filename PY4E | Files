Opening a File: open()
handle = open(filename, mode)
returns a handle use to manipulate the file
filename is a string
mode is optional and should be 'r' if we are planning to read the file and 'w' if we are going to write to the file
fhand = open('mbox.txt', 'r')

Newline Character: \n
Newline is still one character
>>> stuff = 'Hello\nWorld!'
>>> print(stuff)
Hello
World!
Note: the print will add another \n at the end of the line, but that one would not be counted into the length

File Handle as a Sequence
xfile = open('mbox.txt')
for cheese in xfile:
    print(cheese)   <-- you are getting the file line by line
    
Counting Lines in a File
- open a file read-only
- use a for loop to read each line
- count the lines and print out the number of lines
fhand = open('mbox.txt')
count = 0
for line in fhand:
    count = count + 1
print('Line Count:', count)

$ python open.py
Line Count: 132045


Reading the *Whole* File
We can read the whole file (new lines and all) into a single string
>>> fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
>>> inp = fhand.read()   <--read method
>>> print(len(inp))
94626
>>> print(inp[:20])

Searching Through a File
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    if line.startswith('From:'):
        print(line)
Note: the output would have newlines between each line
as each line from the file has a newline at the end, 
then the print statement adds a newline to each line
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()   <---really important to get rid of newlines
    if line.startswith('From:'):
        print(line)
        
Skipping with continue:
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if not line.startswith('From:'):
        continue
    print(line)
    
Using in to select lines
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if not '@uct.ac.za' in line:
        continue
    print(line)
    
fname = input('Enter the file name:  ')
fhand = open(fname)

Bad File Names:
fname = input('Enter the file name:  ')
try:
    fhand = open(fname)  <--dangerous code block
except:
    print('File cannot be opened:', fname)
    quit()  <-- if we dont put quit() here, the reminding code will still run, and it will blow up (fhand not defined properly)
 count = 0
 for line in fhand:
    if line.startswith('Subject:') :
      count = count + 1
 print('There were', count, 'subject lines in', fname)
 Output:
 Enter the file name: mbox.txt
 There were 1797 subject lines in mbox.txt
 Enter the file name: nana boo boo
 File cannot be opened: nana boo boo
